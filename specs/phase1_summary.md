# Phase 1 Implementation Summary: `solai` Package v0.4.0

This document provides a detailed summary of the work completed during Phase 1 of the `solidity-ai-pipeline` project. The primary goal of this phase was to create a foundational, installable Python package named `solai` (version 0.4.0) that provides the basic CLI structure and environment setup necessary for integrating AI tools into Solidity development workflows.

Refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) for quick start instructions and general usage information.

## 1. Project Initialization and Structure

- **Repository:** A new Git repository `solidity-ai-pipeline` was initialized.
- **Directory Structure:** The core source code layout was established:
  - `src/solai/`: Main package source.
  - `src/solai/templates/`: Contains template files to be injected into user projects.
  - `src/solai/docker/`: Holds Dockerfile definitions.
  - `specs/`: Directory for specification and summary documents (this file).
  - `.github/workflows/`: For CI/CD configurations.

## 2. Packaging (`pyproject.toml`)

A `pyproject.toml` file was created to manage the build process and package metadata using the Hatchling build backend.

- **Build System:** `hatchling>=1.18` specified.
- **Project Metadata:**
  - `name`: `solai`
  - `version`: `0.4.0`
  - `description`: "Plug-and-play AI improvement pipeline for Solidity projects"
  - `readme`: `README.md`
  - `requires-python`: `>=3.12`
  - `license`: `MIT` (Initially set to BUSL-1.1, corrected to MIT during review).
  - `authors`: `SoloLabs`
- **Dependencies:**
  - Core: `typer>=0.12`, `rich>=13`, `pyyaml>=6`.
  - *Note:* `sweagent>=1.0` and `swe-rex>=1.0` were initially included but removed temporarily due to unavailability on PyPI during testing. These will be added back when appropriate.
- **Scripts:** A console script entry point was defined: `solai = solai.cli:app`.
- **Build Config:** Specified the package directory: `packages = ["src/solai"]`. An erroneous inline comment was removed during review.

## 3. Source Code Implementation (`src/solai/`)

### 3.1. `__init__.py`

- Defines the package version: `__version__ = "0.4.0"`.
- Exports the version via `__all__`.

### 3.2. `cli.py`

- Implements the command-line interface using `Typer`.
- **`init` command:**
  - Copies template files (`dot_solai.yaml`, `Makefile.inc`, `gitignore_snip.txt`) from the package's `templates` directory to the user's current working directory.
  - Renames `dot_solai.yaml` to `.solai.yaml`.
  - Includes an `--update` (`-u`) flag to overwrite existing files.
  - **Gitignore Handling:** If a `.gitignore` file exists in the target directory, the contents of `gitignore_snip.txt` are appended (within `# >>> solai` / `# <<< solai` markers) if not already present. This logic was added during the code review phase.
  - Outputs a message prompting the user to run `make bootstrap-solai`.
- **`run` command:**
  - Acts as a placeholder for the main task execution logic.
  - Accepts `--config` (defaulting to `.solai.yaml`), `--once` (defaulting to `True`), and `--max-concurrency` (defaulting to 4) options.
  - Calls the `run_backlog` function from `runner.py`.
- **`doctor` command:**
  - Provides an environment self-test mechanism.
  - Calls the `doctor` function from `runner.py` (imported as `run_doctor` to avoid naming conflicts, corrected during review).

### 3.3. `runner.py`

- Contains the core logic for the `doctor` and (stubbed) `run` commands.
- **`_check` function:** Helper to run shell commands and print success/failure messages. Exits on failure.
- **`_check_python_package` function:** Helper to check if essential Python packages can be imported (added during review, though `sweagent`/`swe-rex` checks are currently commented out).
- **`image_present` function:** Helper to check if a specific Docker image tag exists locally. (Initially checked for digest, reverted to tag check during testing).
- **`doctor` function (`run_doctor`):**
  - Verifies Python version (`>=3.12`).
  - Checks for required command-line tools: `pipx`, `docker` (CLI and engine running), `forge`, `slither`. Error messages guide the user if a tool is missing.
  - Checks if the `foundry_sol:0.4.0` Docker image exists.
  - If the image is missing, it attempts to build it using `src/solai/docker/foundry_sol.Dockerfile`.
  - Includes error handling for `docker build` failures, providing hints to the user (e.g., check network, Docker daemon status).
  - Prints a success message upon completion.
- **`run_backlog` function (Stub):**
  - Checks if the specified configuration file exists.
  - Prints a placeholder message indicating it would start the backlog runner.
  - Uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` initialized with the `max_concurrency` parameter (wired up during review).

## 4. Template Files (`src/solai/templates/`)

- **`dot_solai.yaml`:** Default configuration file. Includes placeholders for agent settings, environment details (Docker image tag `foundry_sol:0.4.0`), post-startup commands, backlog file location, and worktree directory.
- **`Makefile.inc`:** A snippet intended to be included in the user project's main `Makefile`.
  - `bootstrap-solai` target: Ensures `pipx` path, installs or upgrades `solai` via `pipx`, and runs `solai doctor`.
  - `solai-run` target: Simple alias for `solai run`.
- **`gitignore_snip.txt`:** Contains lines to ignore `solai`'s working directories (`.solai/worktrees/`, `.solai/logs/`).

## 5. Docker Environment (`src/solai/docker/`)

- **`foundry_sol.Dockerfile`:**
  - Based on the official Foundry image (`ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest`).
  - Sets `USER root` to perform installations.
  - Runs `apt-get update` and installs `python3-pip`.
  - Uses `pip install --no-cache-dir` to install `slither-analyzer` and `swe-rex`. (Corrected from an initial attempt to install `slither-analyzer` via `apt-get`).
  - Adds `/root/.local/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable to ensure pip-installed binaries are found.

## 6. Documentation and CI

- **`README.md`:** Created a basic README providing:
  - Project description.
  - Installation instructions using `pipx`.
  - A Quick Start guide demonstrating the `init -> bootstrap -> run` flow.
  - A list of requirements (Python 3.12+, Docker, Foundry, Slither, SWE-Agent/ReX).
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`:** A GitHub Actions workflow was added:
  - Triggered on push/pull_request to `main`.
  - Runs on `ubuntu-latest`.
  - Checks out code.
  - Sets up Python 3.12.
  - Sets up QEMU and Docker Buildx (added during review).
  - Installs build tools (`pip`, `build`).
  - Builds the package (`python -m build`).
  - Tests installation using `pipx install` on the built wheel and runs `solai doctor`.

## 7. Testing and Verification

Phase 1 concluded with thorough local testing:

1. **Build Environment:** A virtual environment was created (`python3 -m venv venv`). Build tools (`build`, `hatchling`) were installed.
2. **Package Build:** The package was successfully built into a wheel file (`dist/solai-0.4.0-py3-none-any.whl`) using `python -m build`.
3. **Installation:**
    - Initial attempts using `pipx install dist/*.whl` revealed missing dependencies (`sweagent`, `swe-rex`) which were temporarily removed.
    - Further `pipx` installation attempts showed path issues or module resolution problems.
    - Successful installation was achieved using development mode within the virtual environment: `pip install -e .`. This allowed testing the commands directly.
4. **Functional Testing (in `/tmp/test-solai`):**
    - Created a minimal Solidity project (`G.sol`).
    - `solai init`: Correctly created `.solai.yaml`, `Makefile.inc`, `gitignore_snip.txt`.
    - Created a root `Makefile` (`include Makefile.inc`).
    - Installed prerequisites (`slither-analyzer` via `pip` in the venv).
    - Ensured Docker Desktop was running.
    - `make bootstrap-solai`: Successfully ran `pipx ensurepath`, confirmed `solai` installation (via `-e .`), and ran `solai doctor`.
    - `solai doctor` (direct & via make): Verified all checks passed, including the automatic Docker image build for `foundry_sol:0.4.0`. Dockerfile issues (permissions, package installation method) were identified and fixed during this process.
    - `make solai-run`: Successfully executed the stub `run` command, demonstrating the CLI entry point and parameter passing (`max_concurrency`).

## 8. Conclusion

Phase 1 successfully delivered the `solai` v0.4.0 package skeleton. It provides a working foundation with CLI commands for project initialization (`init`), environment verification (`doctor`), and a placeholder for task execution (`run`). The package includes necessary templates and a self-contained Docker build process. Key issues identified during review and testing (dependency management, Dockerfile commands, CLI logic, `.gitignore` handling) were addressed. The project is now ready for subsequent phases focusing on implementing the core backlog running and AI agent orchestration logic.
